                <p>Hello! My name is Matt Puentes. I'm a Computer Science Student at
                <a href="https://www.wpi.edu">WPI</a>, and I'm a proud member of the
                <a href="https://www.sfs.opm.gov/">CyberCorps SFS program</a>.</p>
                <p>
                    This page was made to show off the portfolio of projects I
                    created throughout the duration of WPI's
                    <a href="https://cs3041-18b.github.io/"> Human-Computer Interaction
                    course.</a> I'm quite proud of what I've done, and I'd love it if you took a look!
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the end of the term, we compiled all of the lessons we
                    learned into one final paper, called our "Design Manifesto".

                            This project involved the re-design of the Worcester
                             Public Library website for a certain demographic.
                             We were assigned "retirees who are amateur
                             metalworkers", and tried to make the website more
                             readable for an elderly audience.

                            In this project, we were expected to discuss a tense
                            topic with a user through the medium of a chatbot.
                            In order to do this, we mapped out a full
                            conversation tree and tried to use a positive tone
                            as much as possible to sway the user to our side.
                            Our chosen topic was that of vaccines and whether or
                            not they are harmful.

                            This project was designed to communicate an
                            understanding to the end user through the use of
                            graphing and design. The project had two sides to
                            it: "Clear communication" and "Persuasive
                            communication". As the team member responsible for
                            the latter of the two, I used <a href="https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/python/music/music.html">this dataset</a>
                            and a mixture of informative visuals and annoying audio
                            to try and convince users that music had become "too loud".

                            This project had us using the affectiva library in
                            order to read the user's emotions. The goal was to
                            somehow use this data to improve the wellbeing of
                            the user somehow. The way my group settled on was
                            to use the emotion tracking capabilities to track
                            and graph a User's reaction to certain advertisements.
                            We reasoned that it would benifit the user by letting
                            companies serve up better advertisements that gave
                            way to more positive emotions.

                    This final project had us building 3D enviroments using A-Frame,
                    a web-based solution to 3D enviroments, allowing users to define
                    them using just HTML. Our group decided to make a VR pet in
                    that the user could interact with. The final product involved
                    several different animations the pet could perform, as well as
                    several ways the user could interact with the pet.
